# hello-world

Hey Everyone.

I'm currently a biologist with specializations in medical entomology, wildlife biology, and statistics. I'm proficient in R and am working through a couple Python courses on Udemy to add that to my toolbox. My hope is to open up new career paths while also learning coding skills that can benefit my current track. This seems like a great place and community to do just that while also contributing to valuable projects.
